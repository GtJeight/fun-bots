Welcome to the fun-bots repository. This is a mod for [Venice Unleashed](https://veniceunleashed.net/) to bring highly configurable and intelligent virtual bots to your Battlefield 3 server.

Do you enjoy this mod? Feel free to [Donate](https://www.paypal.me/joe91de)

### SUMMARY!
Quite fun to use bots on different maps and gamemodes!
- Bots can walk around, shoot and attack enemies using grenades, RPGs and other weaponry. [Which maps are supported?](https://github.com/Joe91/fun-bots/blob/master/Supported-maps.md)
- Bots can drive all kinds of vehicles (on supported maps)
- Need something a bit more? [Create your own traces](https://github.com/Joe91/fun-bots/wiki/Traces) using an easy-to-use trace manager (press <kbd>F12</kbd> in a game)
- And all this, [highly configurable](https://github.com/Joe91/fun-bots/wiki/Basic-Configuration) to suit your needs using an easy-to-use in-game editor (accessible by pressing <kbd>F12</kbd>).
- Want to see some Gameplay? [Here is a gameplay video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRA7RjqXRgk&lc=UgwP_9avBu3YTHdhSiZ4AaABAg.9UmWfabUSZ39UmcTFJsgOc) by EUWINPRO.
